      question: 'What is the maximum home loan amount I can get?',
      answer: 'The maximum home loan amount depends on your income, credit score (preferably 750+), existing liabilities, and property value. Generally, banks offer 75-90% of the property\'s market value. Your EMI should not exceed 40-50% of your monthly income.',
      category: 'Home Loans'
    },
    {
      id: '2',
      question: 'What is the minimum and maximum age limit for loans?',
      answer: 'For most loans, the minimum age is 21-23 years and maximum age is 65-70 years at the time of loan maturity. The exact limits vary based on your employment type (salaried vs self-employed) and the specific bank\'s policy.',
      category: 'General'
    },
    {
      id: '3',
      question: 'What is a good CIBIL score for loan approval?',
      answer: 'A CIBIL score of 750+ is considered excellent and ensures better loan approval chances with lower interest rates. Scores between 650-749 are acceptable but may result in higher interest rates. Below 650, loan approval becomes challenging.',
      category: 'Credit Score'
    },
    {
      id: '4',
      question: 'Can I have a co-applicant for my loan?',
      answer: 'Yes, you can add a co-applicant (spouse, parent, or sibling) to your loan application. This improves your eligibility by combining both incomes and offers tax benefits for both applicants. The co-applicant becomes equally responsible for loan repayment.',
      category: 'General'
    },
    {
      id: '5',
      question: 'What types of properties qualify for home loans?',
      answer: 'Home loans are available for new/resale apartments, independent houses, plots with construction, home construction, renovation, extension, and balance transfer from other banks. The property should have clear title and necessary approvals.',
      category: 'Home Loans'
    },
    {
      id: '6',
      question: 'Fixed or Floating interest rate - which is better?',
      answer: 'Fixed rates offer predictable EMIs but are typically higher initially. Floating rates change with market conditions and are generally lower initially. Choose fixed if you prefer certainty, floating if you can handle rate fluctuations and want to benefit from potential rate cuts.',
      category: 'Interest Rates'
    },
    {
      id: '7',
      question: 'Can I prepay or foreclose my loan?',
      answer: 'Yes, you can prepay or foreclose your loan. For floating rate loans, there\'s no penalty as per RBI guidelines. Fixed rate loans may have prepayment charges. Part-payments help reduce interest burden and loan tenure significantly.',
      category: 'Repayment'
    },
    {
      id: '8',
      question: 'What happens if I miss an EMI payment?',
      answer: 'Missing EMI payments affects your credit score negatively and attracts penalty charges. Banks typically charge 2-3% penalty on overdue amount. Consistent defaults can lead to loan recall and legal action. Contact your bank immediately if facing payment difficulties.',
      category: 'Repayment'
    },
    {
      id: '9',
      question: 'How long does the loan approval process take?',
      answer: 'Personal loans can be approved within 24-48 hours with proper documentation. Home loans typically take 7-15 days, while business loans may take 3-7 days. The timeline depends on documentation completeness and property verification (for secured loans).',
      category: 'Process'
    },
    {
      id: '10',
      question: 'What documents are required for loan applications?',
      answer: 'Common documents include: Identity proof (Aadhaar/PAN), Address proof, Income proof (salary slips/ITR), Bank statements (3-6 months), Employment certificate, and photographs. Additional documents may be required based on loan type and amount.',
      category: 'Documentation'
